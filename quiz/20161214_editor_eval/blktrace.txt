NAME
       blktrace - generate traces of the i/o traffic on block devices



SYNOPSIS
       blktrace -d dev [ -r debugfs_path ] [ -o output ] [-k ] [ -w time ] [ -a action ] [ -A action_mask ] [ -v ]



DESCRIPTION
       blktrace is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed information about request queue operations up to
       user space. There are three major components: a kernel component, a utility to record the i/o trace information for the
       kernel to user space, and utilities to analyse and view the trace information.  This man page describes blktrace, which
       records the i/o event trace information for a specific block device to a file.

       The blktrace utility extracts event traces from the kernel (via the relaying through the debug file system). Some back‐
       ground  details  concerning  the run-time behaviour of blktrace will help to understand some of the more arcane command
       line options:


       - blktrace receives data from the kernel in buffers passed up through the debug file system (relay). Each device  being
         traced  has  a file created in the mounted directory for the debugfs, which defaults to /sys/kernel/debug -- this can
         be overridden with the -r command line argument.


       - blktrace defaults to collecting all events that can be traced. To limit the events being captured,  you  can  specify
         one or more filter masks via the -a option.

         Alternatively,  one  may  specify  the  entire mask utilising a hexadecimal value that is version-specific. (Requires
         understanding of the internal representation of the filter mask.)


       - As noted above, the events are passed up via a series of buffers stored into debugfs files. The size  and  number  of
         buffers can be specified via the -b and -n arguments respectively.


       - blktrace  stores  the  extracted  data  into files stored in the local directory. The format of the file names is (by
         default) device.blktrace.cpu, where device is the base device name (e.g, if we are tracing /dev/sda, the base  device
         name would be sda); and cpu identifies a CPU for the event stream.

         The device portion of the event file name can be changed via the -o option.


       - blktrace may also be run concurrently with blkparse to produce live output -- to do this specify -o - for blktrace.


       - The  default  behaviour  for blktrace is to run forever until explicitly killed by the user (via a control-C, or kill
         utility invocation).  There are two ways to modify this:


         1. You may utilise the blktrace utility itself to kill a running trace -- via the -k option.


         2. You can specify a run-time duration for blktrace via the -w option -- then blktrace will  run  for  the  specified
            number of seconds, and then halt.



OPTIONS
       -A hex-mask
       --set-mask=hex-mask
              Set filter mask to hex-mask (see below for masks)

       -a mask
       --act-mask=mask
              Add mask to current filter (see below for masks)

       -b size
       --buffer-size=size
              Specifies buffer size for event extraction (scaled by 1024). The default buffer size is 512KiB.

       -d dev
       --dev=dev
              Adds dev as a device to trace

       -I file
       --input-devs=file
              Adds the devices found in file as devices to trace

       -k
       --kill
              Kill on-going trace

       -n num-sub
       --num-sub=num-sub
              Specifies number of buffers to use. blktrace defaults to 4 sub buffers.

       -o file
       --output=file
              Prepend file to output file name(s)

       -r rel-path
       --relay=rel-path
              Specifies debugfs mount point

       -V
       --version Outputs version

       -w seconds
       --stopwatch=seconds
              Sets run time to the number of seconds specified



FILTER MASKS
       The  following  masks  may  be passed with the -a command line option, multiple filters may be combined via multiple -a
       command line options.

              barrier: barrier attribute
              complete: completed by driver
              fs: requests
              issue: issued to driver
              pc: packet command events
              queue: queue operations
              read: read traces
              requeue: requeue operations
              sync: synchronous attribute
              write: write traces
              notify: trace messages



REQUEST TYPES
       blktrace distinguishes between two types of block layer requests, file system and SCSI commands. The former are  dubbed
       fs  requests,  the latter pc requests. File system requests are normal read/write operations, i.e.  any type of read or
       write from a specific disk location at a given size. These requests typically originate from a user process,  but  they
       may  also  be  initiated  by  the vm flushing dirty data to disk or the file system syncing a super or journal block to
       disk. pc requests are SCSI commands. blktrace sends the command data block as a payload so that blkparse can decode it.



EXAMPLES
       To trace the i/o on the device /dev/hda and parse the output to human readable form, use the following command:

           % blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -

       This same behaviour can be achieve with the convenience script btrace.  The command

           % btrace /dev/sda

       has exactly the same effect as the previous command. See btrace (8) for more information.

       To trace the i/o on a device and save the output for later processing with blkparse, use blktrace like this:

           % blktrace /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       This will trace i/o on the devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb and save the recorded information in the files sda and sdb  in
       the  current directory, for the two different devices, respectively.  This trace information can later be parsed by the
       blkparse utility:

           % blkparse sda sdb

       which will output the previously recorded tracing information in human readable form to stdout.  See blkparse  (1)  for
       more information.
